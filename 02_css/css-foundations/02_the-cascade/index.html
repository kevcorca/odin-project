    <h1>The Cascade</h1>
    <h2>Specificity</h2>
    <!-- Example 1
    <div class="main">
        <div class="list subsection">Red text</div>
    </div> -->
    <!-- Example 2
    <div class="main">
        <div class="list" id="subsection">Blue text</div>
    </div> -->
    <!-- Example 3 -->
    <div class="main">
        <div class="list" id="subsection">Red text on yellow background</div>
    </div>

    <h2>Inheritance</h2>
    <!-- CSS properties that when is applied, are inherited by the descendants of the element -->
    <!-- Typography properties are inherites, while most properties aren't -->
    <!-- Example 1 -->
    <div id="parent">
        <div class="child"></div>
    </div>

    <h2>Rule Order</h2>
    <!-- tie-breaker is the rule order, whichever rule was the last defined is the winner -->
    
    <p>1st: Cascade</p>
    <p>2nd: Inheritance</p>
    <p>3rd: Rule Order</p>

            <h1>The Cascade of CSS</h1>
            <p>For conflicting rules, the cascade enters to decide which rule applies</p>
            <p>There are three main aspects to consider on the cascade</p>
            <br>
            <h2>The Specificity</h2>
            <p>A more specific declaration takes precedence over less specific ones.</p>
            <p>The selectors contributing to specificity are in importance</p>
            <p>1st: ID selectors, 2nd: Class selectors and 3rd: Type Selectors</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Inheritance</h2>
            <p>There are some properties that are inherited to the descendants.</p>
            <p>Typically the typography based properties are inherited (color, font-size, font-family)</p>
            <br>
            <h2>Rule Order</h2>
            <p>The tie-breaker are the rule order, that says: the last rule defined is the winner.</p>
